# Mass Email Form
I created this PHP site to standardize a form we use to send mass email communications. Most of it configurable via JSON and the config.php file. I will be adding to this as the needs present themselves.

## Requirements
The mailing feature uses [Swift Mailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html)

You can install SwiftMailer using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) after entering the directory:

> composer require "swiftmailer/swiftmailer:^6.0"
